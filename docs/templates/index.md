# Template Syntax

## Overview

Ensconce uses a template language based on a version on Django.

This was ported to .net and later brought directly into Ensconce when support for the port ceased.

The port is based on [version 1.8](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/ref/templates/builtins/#built-in-template-tags-and-filters) of Django, though not all functionality was ported.

To verify support, this section will detail the known working template syntax elements.

These are broken down into 3 sections

* [Filters](filters)
* [Operators](operators)
* [Tags](tags)
