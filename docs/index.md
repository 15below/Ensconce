# Overview

The 15below Ensconce command line tool is the perfect tool to help deploy your applications onto Windows machines.

At 15below, we use Ensconce alongside [Octopus Deploy](https://octopus.com) as part of our Powershell deployment scripting.

Ensconce can be called 2 ways, either by direct call to the `Ensconce.Console.exe` or by adding the `deployHelp.ps1` script to the top of your Powershell files.
